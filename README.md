# ♟️ Tic-Tac-Toe - A Ruby OOP Project

Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe**, a command-line game developed in **pure Ruby** as part of the [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/) curriculum.

This project puts object-oriented programming (OOP) principles into practice through a classic and strategic game.
